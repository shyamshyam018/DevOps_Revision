 2. File Permissions & Ownership
Every file/directory in Linux has permissions for 3 types of users:


Category	Who?
u	User (owner)
g	Group
o	Others
‚úÖ Permission Types

Symbol	Meaning	Numeric
r	Read	4
w	Write	2
x	Execute	1
-	No permission	0

üîê View File Permissions

ls -l

Example output:

-rwxr-xr-- 1 shyam staff 1024 Apr 21 script.sh

üîç Breakdown:

- = regular file

rwx = user has read, write, execute

r-x = group has read and execute

r-- = others have read

‚úÖ Change Permissions

chmod u+x script.sh         # give execute permission to user
chmod 755 script.sh         # rwx for user, rx for group and others
chmod -x file.sh            # remove execute for all

‚úÖ Change Ownership

chown newuser:newgroup file.txt


-------------------------------------------------


3. Process Management (ps, top, kill)

‚úÖ List Running Processes
ps aux                 # All processes
ps -ef                 # Full format
ps -u <username>       # User-specific


‚úÖ Real-Time Process Monitoring
top                   # Shows CPU/memory live
htop                  # (if installed ‚Äì more visual)

‚úÖ Killing Processes
Command	Description
kill <PID>	Kill by PID
kill -9 <PID>	Force kill
pkill <name>	Kill by name
ps aux | grep python         # find process
kill 1234                    # normal kill
kill -9 1234                 # force kill
pkill chrome                 # kill by name
üîí Use with caution! Killing critical processes like init, systemd, etc., will crash your system.

4. Bash Script Creation & Execution

‚úÖ Step 1: Create the Script
nano hello.sh
Add content:


#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, $USER!"
date

‚úÖ Step 2: Make It Executable
chmod +x hello.sh

‚úÖ Step 3: Run the Script
./hello.sh
OR with interpreter:


bash hello.sh

‚úÖ Script Example with Condition & Loop
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "$num is greater than 10"
else
    echo "$num is 10 or less"
fi

for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Loop $i"
done
