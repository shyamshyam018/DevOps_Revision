🔹 1. What is Git?
Definition:
Git is a version control system (VCS) used to track changes in code/files over time.

Think of Git like a "Time Machine" for your code.

Why does Git exist?
To track who changed what and when.

To collaborate with others on the same codebase.

To revert back to any previous version of your project.

🔹 2. What is Version Control?
Imagine:
You’re writing a document:

You make Version 1.

Then Version 2 with some changes.

Then Version 3...

You want to:

Go back to Version 1? ✅

Know what changed from Version 1 to 2? ✅

Collaborate with someone else on Version 2 without messing up your copy? ✅

This is what version control systems do!

🔹 3. Git vs GitHub
Git	GitHub
Software/tool installed locally	Online platform (hosted on the web)
Used to track changes in code	Used to store Git repositories online
Works offline	Needs internet
You push your code to GitHub	GitHub receives your pushed code
No user interface (command line)	Has web interface (GitHub.com)
Analogy:
Git = Your notebook where you write versions

GitHub = Cloud backup of your notebook

🔹 4. How Git Works (Core Concepts)
🧠 Git Internals – In Simple Terms
Git works on snapshots, not differences.

Every time you commit, Git takes a snapshot of all your files (efficiently).

Git stores these snapshots as objects in a local .git folder.

Key Concepts:
Concept	Meaning
Repository (repo)	A Git-managed project directory
Commit	A saved version of your project
Branch	A separate version of your project to test new features
Merge	Combining two branches
Clone	Copying a remote repo to your local system
Push	Uploading commits to GitHub
Pull	Downloading new changes from GitHub
Staging Area	Where changes wait before being committed
🔹 5. Installing Git
✅ Steps:
Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/

Install it and use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git --version
🔹 6. Basic Git Workflow
Here's the most basic flow:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Initialize Git in your project folder
git init

# Step 2: Track changes
git add filename_or_dot

# Step 3: Save a snapshot (commit)
git commit -m "Your message here"

# Step 4: Connect to GitHub repo (first time only)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

# Step 5: Push your local code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
🔹 7. Creating a GitHub Repo
Go to GitHub

Click New Repository

Name it and choose public/private

Do NOT initialize with README (if already git init locally)

🔹 8. Visual Analogy of Git Flow

Your Folder
│
├── git init
│
├── git add
│   └── Staging Area
│
├── git commit
│   └── Local Git History (Version control)
│
├── git push
    └── Remote Repository (GitHub)
🔹 9. Why Do People Use Git & GitHub?
To collaborate with others (especially in companies)

To back up code online

To showcase projects (especially for resumes)

To work on features separately without breaking the main app

To contribute to open-source projects

🔹 10. GitHub is Not the Only One!
There are other remote Git repo hosts like:

GitLab

Bitbucket

Azure DevOps

But GitHub is the most popular.
